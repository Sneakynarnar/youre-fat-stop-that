# You're fat, stop that.
You're fat, stop that! This is a no nonsense fitness app that will sort you're life out

# AI usage

I have used copilot throughout this project in order to help identify bugs faster, and quick start development for my pages.

For example if I were to start a new html file I'd ask copilot to make a basic html file for a dashboard, then I'd change it to exactly I what I want

If I was stuck on how to do something, I would usually ask copilot. For example I was not sure how to implement a working map on my page and copilot guided me through setting up the google API in order to do that

# If I had more time #
- Overwriting functionality of back, forward and refresh buttons on the browser for my SPA portion
- Multiplayer workouts with sockets (one more week and this would have been fully working)
- Calorie burnt tracker
- Was gonna make the app shout insults at you.
- localisation. Wanted to make the page avaliable in another (made up) language for proof of concept
- Would have tried to write my own JWT module
- A way to speed up time to test streaks / daily resets
- Was going to make custom music for the app 
- Would make the app more rude, since that was the point of the app
- Usage of the accelerometer on mobile
- Would implement my own login system to go with oauth.
- Unit testing.
- Community exercise board could have a like / dislike functionality in order to see the good and bad workout routines, could even implement a karma system and users could be able to follow other workout makers
- More advanced css
- Although the app is completely usable on mobile, I could have utilised media queries more to display content in a way more fitting for portrait screens.
# Security Issues / Bugs and non-complete features

 - Quite easy to fabricated the completion of exercises, in future this should be handled on the server with timing.
